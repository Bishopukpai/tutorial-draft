# How To Prevent Broken Authentication in React.js with Password Complexity Check Method

## Introduction

Broken Authentication Attack is one of the most popular and viral web application vulnerability attacks .

Broken authentication attacks can occur in different ways. Also, there are different factors and loopholes in a web application that can make it  vulnerable to this attack. 
And allowing users to make use of weak and easy-to-guess passwords is a big factor. 
This makes it possible for attackers to easily gain access to accounts with weak password credentials by guessing and using a credential stuffing approach. 
Therefore, it is important to put a password checker in place, that will make sure that the password provided by users during registration is strong enough.

In this tutorial, we will build a React application that uses a password checker to prevent users from creating accounts with weak passwords. 
Weâ€™ll also integrate a progress bar into our application that will indicate the strength of the password to the user.

At the end of this tutorial, you will understand the requirements for building a secured React application that protects against broken authentication attacks.
